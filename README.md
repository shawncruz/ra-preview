This app seeks to fill a gap that currently exists between music streaming platforms and music event platforms: As a listener whose interested in finding live music, give me a central place to listen to the artists who will be playing near me soon.

Currently, most music streaming platforms allow users to see if an artist they like is playing in their area. However, it's often the case that your favorite artists aren't playing in your area.

Currently, music event platforms like Resident Advisor allow users to browse a list of events playing in a selected region. Often times I personally find that I'm not familiar with the artists playing upcoming events, but generally enjoy watching live music. For a given night there might be 10 separate events in NYC, all with multiple artists that I'm not familiar. In order to decide which artists I'd like, I have to click through each event then click into each artist's SoundCloud which might not even exist. If there are 10 shows with 3 artists playing at each show, that means I'd have to click through 10 different event pages and then click through and listen to 30 different SoundCloud accounts. This is just for a single night!

Instead, it would be more efficient to have central place to listen to all artists that are playing upcoming shows in the NYC area. The great thing is that with this playlist, there's a (virtual) guarantee that this artist will be playing an upcoming show.

This playlist can be looked at as more of a "Discover Who's Playing In My Area" feature in Spotify.
