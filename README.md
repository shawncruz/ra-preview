# ra-preview

**Product Problem:** As a listener who's interested in finding live music, I want a centralized place to listen to the artists who will be playing near me.

**Solution:** `ra-preview` creates a playlist of artists who are playing in NYC over the next 2 week period. The playlist is updated daily.

Future Improvements:
- Add more regions
- Add a way to link artist names to event pages so that listeners can easily hop to ra.co to purchase tickets.
